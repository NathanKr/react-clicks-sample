Show clicks on the browser tab in 3 ways

no need for useState or useEffect because clicks is not shown on the dom . closure is used


<h2>ShowClicksUsingClass</h2>
Here clicks are shown also on the DOM thus state and componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate are used

<h2>ShowClicksUsingHooks</h2>
Here clicks are shown also on the DOM thus useState and useEffect are used. No need to duplicated code as done in ShowClicksUsingClass via componentDidMount\componentDidUpdate
